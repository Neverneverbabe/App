# App

This repository includes various scripts for a movie streaming application.

The **NetflixModal.jsx** component demonstrates how to build a Netflix-style modal in React using Tailwind CSS. It features a gradient overlay to blend the image background with the modal, responsive layout, and optional fade-in animation defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

To integrate it in a React project:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom tailwindcss
   ```
2. Configure Tailwind CSS using the provided `tailwind.config.js`.
3. Import and use `NetflixModal` within your React application.

The repository's existing HTML and JavaScript files are unrelated to React and may require additional setup.
