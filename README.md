# Watchlist App

This project is a progressive web application that uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API and Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Configuration

Two configuration files provide the necessary credentials:

- `config.js` – contains the TMDB API key and TMDB base URLs.
- `firebase-config.js` – contains your Firebase project settings.

Both files already include example credentials. Replace these with your own keys if you deploy your own instance.

## Running

Serve `index.html` with any static server. The application is fully client-side and does not require a separate build step.
